// Majority.h     Track changing (small nonnegative int) value
//
// Track a series of small int values, taking a vote after each new value
// shows up. The idea of the vote is to determine what value has shown up
// the majority of the time recently. The newValue: method registers a
// new value. The vote method returns value that was the majority of the
// most recent k values, where k is controlled by the quorum property.
// The votes method returns a history of the recent votes (an NSArray of
// NSNumbers). In both cases, a vote can be given as MAJORITY_NOQUORUM
// (not enough values have shown up yet) or as MAJORITY_NOMAJORITY (there
// are enough values, but no clear majority).
//
// The code depends on the values being nonnegative and really small. The
// maxValue property gives the largest allowed value. (For TGV, the
// largest value is 4. Like I said, really small.)
//
