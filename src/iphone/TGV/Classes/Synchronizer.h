// Synchronizer.h     Decide when it's a good time to do a periodic action
//
// The basic idea is that there are some things you want to do every now and
// then. If vocal guidance is on, there are some cases where you'd like to
// synchronize with the guidance announcements. If vocal guidance is off, you
// just want to do the things every now and then.
//
// So this class has a manual and automatic mode. In manual mode, the good
// times are controlled externally through the goodTime property. In automatic
// mode, each new time is initiated by the step method, and its goodness is
// determined by elapsed time.
//
